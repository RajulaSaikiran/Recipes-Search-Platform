Project Description:
   The "Recipes Search Platform" is a full-stack web application designed to allow users to search and filter through a large collection of recipes efficiently. Built with React for the frontend and Flask for the 
   backend, the application utilizes OpenSearch to index and retrieve recipes based on various criteria, including ingredients, calories, fat, sodium, and ratings. The user interface is inspired by popular 
   e-commerce platforms like Flipkart and Amazon, ensuring intuitive navigation and a responsive design for seamless user experience. The platform integrates modern UI elements and filtering functionality to 
   enhance recipe discovery.

Project Objectives:
  1. Develop a full-stack web application that provides fast and efficient recipe searching and filtering.
  2. Implement a React-based frontend for a user-friendly interface, focusing on responsiveness and ease of use.
  3. Build a Flask-based backend to handle API requests, process search filters, and interact with OpenSearch for data retrieval.
  4. Integrate the EpiRecipes dataset into OpenSearch, allowing users to filter recipes by various attributes and ingredients.
  5. Ensure version control and code management using GitHub for seamless development and collaboration.
This concise description and objectives should be a good fit for presenting your project.

Usage guidelines:
1. Access the Platform:
    Open the web application in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
    Navigate to the home page where youâ€™ll find a search bar and filter options.
    Searching for Recipes:

  2. Keyword Search: Enter a keyword (e.g., "chicken," "pasta") in the search bar to find recipes.
      Multiple Ingredients: Add multiple ingredients to narrow down recipe options (e.g., "chicken, garlic").
      
  3. Filtering Recipes:
      Use the filter panel to refine search results:
        Rating: Adjust the slider to filter by user ratings (e.g., 4 stars and above).
        Calories, Fat, Sodium, Protein: Use sliders to set the desired range for each nutritional value.
        The filtered results will automatically update based on your selections.

  4.Pagination:
      Navigate through search results using the pagination controls at the bottom.
      You can adjust the number of recipes displayed per page by selecting different page size options (e.g., 10, 20, 50 recipes per page).

  5.Recipe Details:
      Click on any recipe card to view detailed information about the recipe, including ingredients, preparation steps, and nutritional facts.

  6.Responsive Design:
      The platform is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a smooth experience across different screen sizes.
  
  7.API Requests (Advanced Users):
      The backend is powered by a Flask API. You can interact with the API directly using tools like Postman or curl by making GET requests to endpoints that return filtered recipe data.

Technologies and frameworks used:
Frontend:
